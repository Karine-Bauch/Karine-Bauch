# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<!--
**Karine-Bauch/Karine-Bauch** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Github is not my main tool for code save, but you can find my contributions in [Froggit](https://lab.frogg.it/Karine-Bauch), based on GitLab.

Software engineer specializing in Python since 2022, I work on back-end and DevOps projects across various sectors, including energy, software, education, and cybersecurity.
I also deliver one-on-one training sessions for professional training organizations.

I support open-source by sponsoring projects such as FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, and Pytest, and I regularly contribute to the GitLab Swepy Knowledge Base as well as open-source projects like ZeroPython and a CI/CD components library.
